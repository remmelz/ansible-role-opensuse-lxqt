# Oh-My-Bash is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your BASH configuration. 
# It comes bundled with a ton of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things 
# that make you shout... If you heard about Oh-My-Zsh before, this project is a shameless 
# fork of that one, but in "Bourne Again Shell".
