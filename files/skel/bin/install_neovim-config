# Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives 
# rom Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and 
# derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want 
# the good parts of Vim, and more.
